    <h1>GOA</h1>
    <p>GOA stands for Goal Oriented Academy. As the name suggests, this isnt just an ordinary IT school</p>
    <h2>why i joined GOA</h2>
    <p>A couple of months ago, I was searching for a good IT academy to start learning programming. One day, an ad for GOA popped up on my screen. I messaged them right away, went through their syllabus—which was the best I had seen so far—and then visited their page</p>
    <p>first thing that amazed me was freedom,freedom of thinking in GOA which is most important for me,also the friendly envoirnment,everyone helping each other.</p>
    <h3>my experience with GOA so far</h3>
    <p>These two weeks at GOA have been amazing. There are excellent mentors, a flawless system, and everything around you motivates you to put in more effort</p>
