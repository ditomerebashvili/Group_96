    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the act of designing, building and maintaining websites and web applications. The field encompasses a broad range of tasks, including everything from coding, to technical design, to the optimization of website or web application performance.</p>
    <p>The three main types of web development are front-end development, back-end development and full-stack development.</p>
    <p>Web developers create and maintain websites and web applications, specifically by creating a website’s code, connecting the site to a server and maintaining its accessibility to users. Web development is responsible for building the sites and applications we use through a web browser in our day-to-day lives</p>
